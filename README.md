# TadBuddy

A companion app for the Frogophone.
Allows parent/carer/educator to control LEDs on the Frogophone using the on screen buttons in TadBuddy, to prompt user to press the matching buttons.
Button presses on both the Frogophone and the app cause the app to play appropriate notes.
TadBuddy supports devices running Android, iOS, and MacOS.


## Instructions

* Before starting up TadBuddy, please ensure Frogophone is set to the default C Major scale, and plugged into the device. A USB adaptor may be required to suit your device.

* On app startup, Frogophone's LEDs will cycle sequentially twice, to indicate successful connection.

* Use the settings screen to choose the key to play in, and instrument/octave/playing mode for both the frog and app users.

* Button presses on both frog and app will play the note with the selected instrument.

* Volume for both frog and app can be adjusted on the main screen.

* To guide the frog user, the app user presses the button with the appropriate note. This causes the matching button on the frog to light up (only the chest buttons 1-6 have LEDs).
